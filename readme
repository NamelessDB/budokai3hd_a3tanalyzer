It analyzes the width, height, offset bitmap, palette offset but it seems to be wrong (?) I will update it to that soon, I want to clarify that in some a3t textures the width and height are not always going to be correct for textures like renders, icons, etc. It is not the tool's fault, it is something strange from the creators of the game, I want to clarify that the pixel format is not included to find it, I will update it soon to that and I will add that mechanic
